### What is API?

- API: Application Programming Interface:
- An API is a set of rules and definitions that allows two or more computer programs or components to communicate with each other.
- In essence, an API serves as a contract between different software components, ensuring they can work together in a predictable and   efficient manner.

### REST (Representational State Transfer):
- REST is a way to design web services so that different software systems can talk to each other over the internet in a simple and           consistent way. 


## How REST API works

- Client: The client sends an HTTP request to the server.
- HTTP Request: The request is received and processed by the server.
- Server: The server retrieves or modifies the resource as needed.
- Resource Representation: The server creates a representation of the resource (often in JSON or XML format).
- erver: The server sends an HTTP response back to the client, including the resource representation.
- This flow demonstrates the key steps involved in a typical interaction with a REST API.

## HTTP Methods:

- RESTful APIs commonly use standard HTTP methods to perform operations:
- GET: Retrieve a resource.
- POST: Create a new resource.
- PUT: Update an existing resource.
- DELETE: Remove a resource.
- PATCH: Partially update a resource.
