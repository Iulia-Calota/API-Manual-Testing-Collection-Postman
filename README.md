# REST (Representational State Transfer):
- REST is a way to design web services so that different software systems can talk to each other over the internet in a simple and           consistent way. 

### RESTful API Characteristics:
### Resources and Endpoints:

- Resources (like users, orders, or products) are accessible via endpoints (URLs).
- Each resource is identified by a unique URI.
# HTTP Methods:

- RESTful APIs commonly use standard HTTP methods to perform operations:
- GET: Retrieve a resource.
- POST: Create a new resource.
- PUT: Update an existing resource.
- DELETE: Remove a resource.
- PATCH: Partially update a resource.
